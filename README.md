# GLASSICOO
# Optical Glass Size Detection App - Glassicoo detects the size and position of optical glass in an input image or video.
# The app uses a template paper with a green background and four red blocks. There will be an optical glass with circular
# montage point and a montage line. Glassicoo detects all of them.
# The app is designed to be used by opticians to help automate the process of inspecting optical glass components.
